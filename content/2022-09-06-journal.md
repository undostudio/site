When I came across Mark MacKay's [work logs](https://method.ac/writing/), I thought to myself, why not try it out as well? I've been meaning to get started on some projects, but they always get put off. Perhaps if I have these logs around, they will be a reminder of how much I don't work on these side projects that I keep telling myself I'll work on.

This first one, well, I've updated my [little website](https://undo.studio), making the visual layout neater and making it easier to spot key elements. One curious thing is that I keep finding the description on there inaccurate or limiting. This time I've changed it around to still capture the essence of my creative endeavors, but leave room for change in the future.
